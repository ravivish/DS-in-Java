    * 1.Initialize span of day 1 as 1.

            than price of stock on current day, Pop the index from stack.
    *  b.If price of stock on the day on top of stack is
            greater than price of stock on current day,
            calculate span as current day â€“ day at top of stack.
    *  c.Push current day index on to stack.
